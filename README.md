# CSCA48: Introduction to Computer Science II

This repository contains the assignments & exercises completed for the course entitled "CSCA48: Introduction to Computer Science II" in the Computer Science Department at the University of Toronto.

## Course Topics

Abstract data types and data structures for implementing them. Linked data structures. Object Oriented Programming. Encapsulation and information-hiding. Testing. Specifications. Analyzing the efficiency of programs. Recursion.

## Exercises

1) Hello World - Prints a few lines about myself.
2) Prime Powers - Implements a function which  accepts one floating point value $x$, and an integer power value $p$, and returns  the value of  $x^{p}$. Use this to print a particular number raised to the prime numbers between 1 to 100.
3) Array Workout - Prints out prime factors of an array of numbers.
4) Fun With Pointers - Implement a function that takes two pointers, one for an input string, and one for a different (don't know what's in it, possibly junk) string, and then updates the destination string so that it contains the same words as the input string, but in reverse order.
5) Caesar Cipher -  Implementing a Caesar Cipher function to encode an input message using a specified input image (input image decides displacement factor for each character), and implementing a decoding function that takes a text encoded with the Caesar cipher, the image used to encode it, and returns the original text.
6) Caesar Break - Decode a given message that has been encrypted using Caesar Cipher, using a dictionary attack.
7) DNA Translate - Includes two functions (one that determines the sequence of amino acids for an input DNA sequence, and one that determines if two sequences use the same number and type of aminoacids (even if they are in different order)).
8) Soduku - Soduku solver using recursion.
9) Summer Plans - Implements function that tells about something fun I planned to do during the next summer.

## Assignments

1) Based on Arrays & Linked Lists (e.g. inserting, deleting, searching)
2) Based on Binary Search Trees & its functions (e.g. insering, deleting, searching, tree traversals, etc.)
3) Food recipe program, based on recursive functions & graphs
